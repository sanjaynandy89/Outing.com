  <h1>Ways to Reach Bhutan From India</h1>

<h1>By Air:</h1>
<p>Flying to Bhutan from India is quite easy. There are two direct airlines, namely, Drukair and Bhutan Airlines 
that operate flights from Delhi, Gaya, Bagdogra, Kolkata, Mumbai and Guwahati to Paro, Bhutan’s only international airport. Indian travellers can be 
offered special fares in Drukair, if the airline is contacted through email.</p>
<h1>By Rail:</h1> 
<p>One of the cheapest ways to reach Bhutan from India is by rail. Hasimara is the nearest railway station to Jaigaon, an Indian town on Indo-Bhutan 
Border. It is situated at a distance of 17 kms from Jaigaon. There are trains to Hasimara from Kolkata (690 kms), Delhi (1663 kms), Ranchi (749 kms), and 
Kanpur (1197 kms). Another station that offers a decent connectivity is situated in New Jalpaiguri. The tickets and timetable is available on Indian Railway’s IRCTC Website. 
Though trains take longer but are quite cost efficient and are ideal for budget travellers.</p>
<h1>By Road:</h1>
<p>The most common way to enter Bhutan from India by road is from Jaigaon town in West Bengal. It is only 4.3 kms from the border town of Bhutan, 
Phuentsholing. Private cabs are available between the two places. People getting down at Bagdogra (by flight) or at New Jalpaiguri (by train) can also
